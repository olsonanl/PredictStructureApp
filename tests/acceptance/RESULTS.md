## Latest: folding_260411.1.sif

Full end-to-end run with all fixes baked into the container.

| Phase | Tests | Passed | Failed | XFail |
|-------|:-----:|:------:|:------:|:-----:|
| **Phase 1** native | 13 | **13** | 0 | 0 |
| **Phase 2** CLI | 64 | **54** | 5 | 5 |
| **Phase 3** service+ws | 36 | **34** | 2 | 0 |
| **Total** | **113** | **101** | **7** | **5** |

Runtime: 198 min (3.3h) on GPUs 0-3

### Phase 1: Native Tools -- 13/13 PASS

| Test | Time |
|------|------|
| Boltz protein+msa | 69s |
| Boltz protein (no msa) | 19s |
| Boltz protein msa:empty | 65s |
| Boltz dna | 62s |
| ESMFold protein GPU | 34s |
| ESMFold protein CPU | 27s |
| Chai protein | 65s |
| Chai protein+msa | 67s |
| Chai dna | 58s |
| OpenFold protein | 96s |
| OpenFold protein+msa | 88s |
| OpenFold dna | 91s |
| AlphaFold protein | 26m |

### Phase 2: CLI -- 54 pass, 5 fail, 5 xfail

| Category | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Auto-selection (5) | 5/5 PASS |
| Debug mode (6) | 6/6 PASS |
| Entity flags (1) | PASS |
| Job batch mode (1) | PASS |
| ESMFold via CLI (8) | 8/8 PASS |
| Boltz via CLI (5) | 5/5 PASS |
| Chai via CLI (7) | 6/6 PASS + 1 xfail (SMILES) |
| AlphaFold via CLI (5) | 3/3 PASS + 2 xfail (DNA/ligand) |
| OpenFold via CLI (8) | 4/8 -- see below |
| Output normalization (7) | 7/7 PASS |
| GPU tool output (3) | 2/3 PASS |

**OpenFold Phase 2 failures (5):**
- `openfold-protein`: PASS prediction, FAIL validation (residue count 326 vs 46)
- `openfold-protein_msa`: rc=1 -- IndexError in MSA processing (input format mismatch)
- `openfold-protein_diff3`: PASS prediction, FAIL validation (residue count)
- `openfold subcommand_full`: PASS prediction, FAIL validation (residue count)
- `openfold gpu_tool_output`: PASS prediction, FAIL validation (residue count)

Root causes: (1) normalizer reports per-atom pLDDT count instead of per-residue
(4 tests), (2) precomputed MSA file naming doesn't match OpenFold's expected
format (1 test).

### Phase 3: Service + Workspace -- 34 pass, 2 fail

| Category | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Preflight (25) | 25/25 PASS |
| Perl syntax | PASS |
| Service: ESMFold input_file | PASS |
| Service: ESMFold text_input | PASS |
| Service: Boltz | PASS |
| Service: OpenFold | PASS |
| Service: Chai | PASS |
| Service: MSA upload (Boltz) | PASS |
| Workspace: p3-whoami | PASS |
| Workspace: p3-ls | FAIL (UTF-8 decode) |
| Workspace: upload+verify | FAIL (listing mismatch) |
| Workspace: ESMFold roundtrip | PASS |

## Container Comparison

| | folding_prod.sif | folding_260411.1.sif | Delta |
|--|:----------------:|:--------------------:|:-----:|
| Phase 1 | 13 pass | 13 pass | -- |
| Phase 2 | 48 pass, 11 fail | 54 pass, 5 fail | +6 |
| Phase 3 | 33 pass, 3 fail | 34 pass, 2 fail | +1 |
| **Total** | **94 pass, 14 fail** | **101 pass, 7 fail** | **+7** |

Improvements in 260411.1:
- OpenFold runs through predict-structure (data_dir, MSA/template defaults fixed)
- ESMFold text_input works (app_spec updated)

## Remaining Failures (7)

| # | Issue | Tests | Severity |
|---|-------|:-----:|----------|
| 1 | OpenFold normalizer residue count (326 vs 46) | 4 | Medium -- per-atom vs per-residue pLDDT |
| 2 | OpenFold precomputed MSA IndexError | 1 | Medium -- MSA file naming mismatch |
| 3 | Workspace p3-ls UTF-8 decode | 1 | Low |
| 4 | Workspace upload verify listing | 1 | Low |

## Multi-Tool Comparison Workflow

**Workflow:** `cwl/workflows/multi-tool-comparison.cwl`

Runs Boltz, OpenFold, Chai, ESMFold on the same input, renames outputs
with tool suffix (model_1.boltz.pdb), and runs protein_compare batch.

### Test Run: sub_9d67ceb8 (crambin, 2026-04-17)

| Step | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| predict_boltz | SUCCESS | |
| predict_openfold | SUCCESS | |
| predict_chai | SUCCESS | |
| predict_esmfold | SUCCESS | |
| compare | SUCCESS | Only compared 2 of 4 structures (see issue #14) |

**Rename working:** CSV shows `model_1.boltz` vs `model_1.esmfold` (tool names visible).

### Issue #14: GoWe compare step runs before all predictions complete

The compare step started as soon as 2 of 4 rename outputs were available,
rather than waiting for all 4. The CWL workflow correctly declares compare's
input as a merge of all 4 rename outputs (`linkMerge: merge_flattened`), but
GoWe appears to dispatch the step as soon as any subset of sources is ready.

**Impact:** Comparison report only includes tools that finished before the
compare step was dispatched. Missing tools are not in the CSV/HTML output.

**Expected:** Compare step should wait for all 4 rename steps to complete
before running, producing a 4-way (6-pair) comparison.

**Workaround:** None currently. Re-running compare manually with all 4 PDBs
after the full workflow completes would produce the correct report.

**Root cause:** Likely a GoWe issue with `linkMerge: merge_flattened` across
multiple source steps. The CWL spec requires all sources to be resolved before
the step can execute.
